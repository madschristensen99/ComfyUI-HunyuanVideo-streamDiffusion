# ComfyUI wrapper nodes for [HunyuanVideo](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo)

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Transformer and VAE (single files, no autodownload):

https://huggingface.co/Kijai/HunyuanVideo_comfy/tree/main

Go to the usual ComfyUI folders (diffusion_models and vae)

LLM text encoder (has autodownload):

https://huggingface.co/Kijai/llava-llama-3-8b-text-encoder-tokenizer

Files go to `ComfyUI/models/LLM/llava-llama-3-8b-text-encoder-tokenizer`

Clip text encoder (has autodownload)

For now using the original https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14, files (only need the .safetensor from the weights) go to:

`ComfyUI/models/clip/clip-vit-large-patch14`

Memory use is entirely dependant on resolution and frame count, don't expect to be able to go very high even on 24GB. 

Good news is that the model can do functional videos even at really low resolutions.
